    <br />
    <h2 class="fw-bolder">Why should Top Quality Consulting help you with User Acceptance Testing? </h2>
      <p>
        User Acceptance Testing (UAT) evaluates whether a product aligns with the needs of end users. While the term "testing" may imply similarity to Quality Assurance (QA), there are distinct differences between the two. Let's explore these terms along with their related concepts and disparities.<br />
      </p>

    <h2 class="fw-bolder">Why is UAT essential?</h2>
      <p>
        The primary objective of acceptance testing is to confirm that the product meets the requirements defined during the product discovery phase and is prepared for launch. According to a survey by Origsoft on UAT usage, over 75 percent of respondents conduct multiple cycles of end-user testing, with 57 percent citing poor product quality as a motivating factor.<br />
      </p>

    <h2 class="fw-bolder">The Importance of UAT and its integration into development:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ensuring alignment with business requirements</strong>: UAT verifies that the product functions as intended in real-world scenarios, enabling end users to address specific issues. By skipping UAT, you risk overlooking critical flaws or system malfunctions, resulting in user dissatisfaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjusting initial requirements</strong>: End users may provide valuable feedback during product testing, suggesting improvements to the software. Incorporating such insights allows you to refine your requirements and deliver a more valuable product to customers.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigating losses</strong>: Firstly, addressing product issues in the early stages of development is more cost-effective. Thus, identifying flaws through UAT enables your development team to enhance the product more efficiently (especially relevant in Agile methodologies). Secondly, we are all familiar with tales of product failures due to inadequate functionality and usability. UAT offers real-world user feedback, significantly reducing the likelihood of losses resulting from an unsuccessful product launch.</li>
